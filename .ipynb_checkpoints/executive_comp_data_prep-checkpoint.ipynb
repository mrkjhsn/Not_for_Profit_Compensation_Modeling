    "#### Final Capstone Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the problem you are attempting to solve?\n",
    "How much such a not-for-profit organization pay it's top management?  Not-for-profit organizations devoted to specific causes have a huge amount of variablity (revenue, number of volunteers, ect.).  How much should not-for-profits award their top managment?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How is your solution valuable?\n",
    "The not-for-profit world doesn't operate by the same rules as the for-profit world.  For instance, some not-for-profit managers might be willing to volunteer their time, or take a pay cut to be involved with an organization they believe in.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is your data source and how will you access it?\n",
    "I will use two data sources made available by Open990(https://www.open990.org/catalog/), an organization dedicated to promoting not-for-profit transparency.  One dataset includes governance information, while the other includes compensation amounts paid to top employees.  Both of these datasets will be downloaded from the above website link in csv format.  Each of them are several million rows in length.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What techniques from the course do you anticipate using?\n",
    "I anticipate using unsupervised learning on the Governance dataset to be able to find organizations that are similar to each other based on information such as number of volunteers or number of independent voting members.  Based on the categories obtained from this step I will use supervised learning on the Compensation datset which includes financial information such as the net assests of the organization to predict the salaries of the not-for-profits top management. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What do you anticipate to be the biggest challenge you’ll face?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on my initial review of the dataset, I believe my biggest challenge will be to effectively cluster using unsupervised learning on the Governance dataset.  Since not-for-profit organizations have such huge size differences from hospitals(lots of fixed assets) to reproductive rights advocacy(lots of volunteers) I think it will be tricky to effectively group them in a way that can be beneficial for the second phase using supervised learning."
