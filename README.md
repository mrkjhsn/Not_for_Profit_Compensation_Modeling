Organizations filing a Form 990 are instructed to report information for current (and some former) officers, directors, trustees, key employees (>150K), and five highest compensated (>100K) employees.

The data for this project was aquired from Open990(https://www.open990.org/catalog/), an organization that aggregates and provides not-for-profit tax return data made public by the IRS.  This dataset has great documentation about what the attributes mean, however this only includes data for 1 year(2016).  The organization that provides this data also provides analytics services with this data for a fee. (https://appliednonprofitresearch.com/customdata/)
