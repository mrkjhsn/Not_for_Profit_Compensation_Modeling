    "## Predicting Executive Salary at Not-for-Profit Organizations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How much should a not-for-profit organization pay it's top management?  Not-for-profit organizations are devoted to myriads of causes and have a huge amount of variablity (mission, revenue, number of volunteers, ect.).  This makes predicting executive salary within these organizations a compelling challenge, and one that machine learning is well suited to make a contribution towards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data source:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project was aquired from [Open990](https://www.open990.org/catalog/), an organization that aggregates and provides not-for-profit tax return data made public by the IRS.  Open990 also provides not-for-profit analytics services with this data for a [fee](https://appliednonprofitresearch.com/customdata/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets have excellent documentation about what the attributes mean, and how the attributes have been mapped over from the 990 tax returns (Form 990, Form 990-EZ, Form 990-PF).  The executive compensation dataset provided by Open990 includes payments made to executives within the tax returns for years 2017 and 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the executive compensation dataset, I used the governance dataset to get additional information about the governance of the organizations paying the executives in the executive dataset.  The governance dataset is mostly made up yes/no responses as to whether the not-for-profit has specific controls in place (conflict of interest policy, whistleblower policy, ect.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The IRS has [guidlines](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-annual-reporting-requirements-meaning-of-reasonable-compensation) on compensation of top executives.  Specifically, it states \"Reasonable compensation is the value that would ordinarily be paid for like services by like enterprises under like circumstances\".  This leaves room for a wide latitude of interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations filing a Form 990 are instructed to report compensation information for current (and some former) officers, directors, trustees, key employees (>150K), and five highest compensated (>100K) employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "My interest in this topic stems from an infomercial I watched a number of years ago.  A charismatic person was raising money for a highly sympathetic cause.  But something about his organization did seem right.  I did a google search.  One of the first results was from a not-for-profit watchdog organization that gave this persons not-for-profit a low score because of the excessive salary this person was awarding himself as the director of the organization.  It occured to me that many not-for-profit organizations with lofty sounding missions may just be fronts for dubious people enriching myselves by appealing to unsuspecting donors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Research questions to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Based on the unique characteristics of a not-for-profit, what should it be paying it's top executives?  \n",
    "1. Is there a correlation between organizations with lax governance standards and disproportionate executive compensation?\n",
    "1. Am I able to identify organizations who are likely paying their management more than they should?\n"

    "### What Made This Project Challenging:\n",
    "1. Many people who choose to be involved with not-for-profits have reasons different than those who choose to be involved in for-profit organizations.\n",
    " 1. The organization might represent a cause they care deeply about.\n",
    " 1. Leadership of the not-for-profit provides an ego boost in place of a competitive salary.\n",
    "1. 501 Subsection categories are highly lopsided towards 501(c)(3) organizations\n",
    "1. Not-for-profits often raise a large share of their money through the connections of it's top managers."
